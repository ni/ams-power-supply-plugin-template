# Getting Started

- Build steps
    - Expand "RT PXI Target"
    - Expand "Build Specifications"
    - Right-click "BLS Power Supply Template" and select "Build"

-  Rename the following project files
    - build file under build specifications
    - class and library
    - project
    - make sure this name change is reflected under configuration on PAtools

- Inisde of the Configuration Params.ctl file, which can be found by expanding "User Custom Config", change and adapt the parameters as needed.

# Using a Real Device

- Ensure that in Process Data.vi from the template, the simulation helper VIs and connections are removed and replaced with driver calls.

- Make sure that inside of the Exit Initialize.vi, the device initialize VI is connected.

- Using the Cleanup (User).vi, make sure that everything is closed and exited such as hardware ports and network references.

# Testing

- Using PA tools
- Make sure to have the right IP address to input for the RMX Power Supply and PXI
- See PAtools Integration README.md for more info and details on how to connect and test
